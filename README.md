# Audio classification project

In this project a neutral network is build to recognize enviromental sound events, such as a dog bark or a doorbell ring. To build the network were used pythons libraries such as `keras`, `tensorflow`, `librosa`, `pytorch`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` among others.

Also some libraries to audio manipulation were developed so tasks as record, play and convert audio files can be accomplished.
